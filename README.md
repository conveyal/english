# Conveyal Style Guide

This is a style guide for [Conveyal](http://conveyal.com). In general, we defer to [Style Manual](http://stylemanual.org/)
for opinions on usage.

## Blog Post Titles

Blog post titles should be in title case; that is, every word should be capitalized [except small incidental words](http://stylemanual.org/#title_capitalisation).

## Blog Post Excerpts

It is important that blog post excerpts be parallel; that is, they should all be of the same part of speech, and moreover should
have roughly the same structure. Typically we have used one to two sentences that describe the subject of the blog post.
These sentences should not use the passive voice. The excerpt should not refer to the post (i.e. we shouldn't say "In this post, . . .")

## References to Conveyal

When we refer to Conveyal doing something, we should say "we are building" rather than "Conveyal is building," in order to make the
tone more conversational.

## References to an Unnamed User

When we refer to an unnamed user, we should say "you can" rather than "one can" or "the user can," again to make the tone
more conversational. This neatly sidesteps issues with gendered pronouns, which should be avoided unless talking about
a specific person of a specific gender.

## The Use of Apostrophes

While in general you should not use an apostrophe to make a word plural, we work with a lot of acronyms, which [do use
an apostrophe for pluralization](http://stylemanual.org/#apostrophe), as in "there were several RFP's." Often you can avoid pluralizing an acronym,
for instance by saying "instances of OTP" or "GTFS feeds." Don't forget to introduce acronyms when they are first used.

## Dashes to Separate Words

If you are using a dash to separate two parts of a sentence, use an em dash, which can be produced in markdown by typing `---` (three hyphens), or on a Mac with `Option-Shift--`.
Don't use spaces. For a range (e.g. Monday–Friday or 10–30), use an en dash, which is `--` (two hyphens) or `Option--`, again with no spaces.

## Oxford Commas

Oxford commas (a comma before the and in a list of one or more items) should be used. If the list items themselves contain commas, replace the delimiters with semicolons. E.g. "New York, Atlanta, and Hong Kong" or 
Atlanta; Hong Kong; and Washington, DC."
